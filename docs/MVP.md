## What We're Building

Law and Order is focused on automating the *day-to-day operations* of law firms, particularly in practice areas like **personal injury**, **immigration**, and **civil litigation**. It’s designed to support firms of all sizes — whether you're solo or managing a team.

### Key Features (MVP)

- **Client Document Management**  
  Automatically generate and organize standard forms and letters (e.g., retainer agreements, demand letters, intake forms).

- **Case Status Tracking**  
  View each client's case pipeline at a glance. Know exactly what needs attention and what's already handled.

- **Automated Follow-ups**  
  Schedule and send reminders to clients for documents, signatures, appointments, or key updates.

- **Audit Logs**  
  Every automated action is logged, timestamped, and easily accessible for compliance and transparency.

- **Web Dashboard (Coming Soon)**  
  Lawyers and staff can log in to view case progress, documents, and pending tasks without needing to learn new tools.

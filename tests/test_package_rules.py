    # If is_demand_ready took conn as an arg, this would be simpler.

    # Patching asyncpg.connect directly is cleaner here if possible
    # For this example, let's assume we can patch where it's called or its
    # source `asyncpg`
    # For simplicity in this initial step, this patching might need refinement
    # based on how `is_demand_ready` accesses `asyncpg.connect` and `settings`.

    # This is a simplified conceptual patch. Actual patching target may vary.

    #     result = await is_demand_ready(incident_id=1)

    # To avoid complex patching in this step, we'll refine tests after seeing the
    # actual call pattern.
    # For now, let's assume a direct call to is_demand_ready would work if
    # patching was perfect.

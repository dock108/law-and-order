Re: Our Client: {{ client.full_name }}
    Your Insured: {{ insured.full_name }}
    Claim Number: {{ claim.number }}
    Date of Loss: {{ incident.date }}

Dear {{ insurance.adjuster_name }}:

Thank you for your settlement offer of ${{ offer.amount }} dated {{ offer.date }} regarding the above-referenced claim. After careful consideration and discussion with our client, we must respectfully decline this offer.

Your offer fails to adequately compensate our client for the following reasons:

1. The offer does not fully account for our client's medical expenses, which currently total ${{ medical_expenses.total }}.

2. The offer makes no provision for our client's ongoing pain and suffering, which continues to significantly impact daily activities.

3. The offer does not appropriately compensate for lost wages and diminished earning capacity, documented at ${{ lost_wages.amount }}.

4. The offer fails to consider the long-term implications of our client's injuries, which may require future medical treatment estimated at ${{ future_medical.estimated_cost }}.

Our client has authorized us to reduce our settlement demand from ${{ demand.original_amount }} to ${{ demand.revised_amount }}. This represents a good faith effort to resolve this matter without the need for litigation.

Please advise within {{ response.timeframe }} days whether your company is willing to increase its offer to an amount that fairly compensates our client for the injuries sustained in this incident.

If we cannot reach an agreement that properly values our client's claim, we are prepared to file suit to protect our client's interests.

Sincerely,

{{ attorney.full_name }}

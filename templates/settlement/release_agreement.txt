That the Undersigned, {{ client.full_name }}, (hereinafter "Releasor"), for and in consideration of the sum of {{ settlement.gross_amount }} Dollars (${{ settlement.gross_amount_numeric }}), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, does hereby for himself/herself, his/her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, release, acquit and forever discharge {{ defendant.name }} and {{ insurance.company_name }} (hereinafter "Releasees"), and all other persons, firms, and corporations, from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, demands, rights, damages, costs, loss of services, expenses, and compensation whatsoever which the Releasor now has or which may hereafter accrue on account of or in any way arising out of any and all known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, bodily and personal injuries and property damage, and the consequences thereof, resulting or to result from the accident, casualty, or event which occurred on or about {{ incident.date }} at or near {{ incident.location }}.

The Releasor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Releasees from any and all liens, claims, demands, or actions for reimbursement from any healthcare provider, insurer, governmental entity, or other third party who has provided, or may in the future provide, medical care, services, or benefits to the Releasor in connection with the incident described herein.

This Release expressly covers and includes all claims for medical expenses, hospital expenses, lost earnings, loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, permanent disability or disfigurement, emotional distress, loss of consortium, and all other damages of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, claimed or unclaimed, and whether based upon negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory.
